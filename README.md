# Jewellery-Store
This project was built solely to demonstrate concepts of DBS using SQL. This is a Windows Form Application, we built it using C#.
# Project Description:
Through this application, users can insert, update, and delete records of their jewellery shop's employees, products, customers and billing information.
# My contribution:
I designed and implemented UI using C#.
Note:
A word document has been added for additional information on our project.
